# Minnesota Reclamation Project

**"Reclaim Minnesota"** — Taking back what was lost. Restoring just order.

## About

The Minnesota Reclamation Project is a comprehensive resource for understanding and addressing governance failures in Minnesota through the lens of Christian retributive justice.

### What This Site Does

1. **Informs**: Documents what is happening in Minnesota governance—fraud, sanctuary policies, crime, life issues, elections—clearly and accurately.

2. **Diagnoses**: Applies a Christian retributivist framework to evaluate where current governance deviates from just law.

3. **Prescribes**: Provides tailored legal solutions for each problem area—where to push, how to push, and which organizations can help.

4. **Constructs**: Articulates a positive Christian alternative—not just what we oppose, but what we're building toward.

5. **Mobilizes**: Equips citizens with tools for action—FOIA templates, contact information, voter guides, prayer guides.

## The Framework

We evaluate governance against six dimensions of Christian retributive justice:

- **Moral Wrong**: Was there a real moral wrong by biblical standards?
- **Legal Clarity**: Is the law clear and limited, or vague and abusable?
- **Proportionality**: Is the penalty commensurate with the actual wrong?
- **Authority**: Are actors operating ministerially or managerially?
- **Procedure**: Were there fair procedures and equal treatment?
- **Orientation**: Is reasoning backward-looking (desert) or forward-looking (social engineering)?

## Issue Domains

- **Fraud & Oversight**: $9B+ potential fraud, state failures, federal intervention
- **Sanctuary & Immigration**: ICE conflicts, Cities Church, official subpoenas
- **Crime & Enforcement**: Carjacking surge, catch-and-release, victim abandonment
- **Life & Family**: Abortion laws, trans refuge, parental rights
- **Election Integrity**: Voter registration, verification, transparency

## Design

The site design draws on Minnesota's distinctive architectural heritage:

- **Prairie School** (Purcell & Elmslie): Horizontal emphasis, earthy tones
- **Minnesota Modernism** (Walker Art Center): Minimalist restraint, bold typography
- **Northern/Scandinavian influence**: Warmth amid austerity, natural textures

## Tech Stack
